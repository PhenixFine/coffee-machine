# coffee-machine
### My first Kotlin project from JetBrains Academy
The file NewCoffee.kt is the final stage implementation of JetBrains Academy's [requirements](https://hyperskill.org/projects/67/stages/365/implement) for the Coffee Machine project.
The file OldCoffee.kt is the previous stage of my code. It does everything the final stage does, but had to be changed to follow the stage six requirements of using enums and a class object ( among other requirements ). Other than using an enum for drinks, I didn't think enums were really needed for this project, but it was good practice for my [unit-converter](https://github.com/PhenixFine/unit-converter) Project.
