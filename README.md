# coffee-machine
The file [NewCoffee.kt](https://github.com/PhenixFine/coffee-machine/blob/master/src/NewCoffee.kt) is the final stage implementation of JetBrains Academy's [requirements](https://hyperskill.org/projects/67/stages/365/implement) for the Coffee Machine project.
The file [OldCoffee.kt](https://github.com/PhenixFine/coffee-machine/blob/master/src/old/OldCoffee.kt) is the previous stage of my code. It does everything the final stage does, but had to be changed to follow the stage six requirements of using enums and a class object ( among other requirements ). Other than using an enum for drinks, I didn't think enums were really needed for this project, but it was good practice for my [unit-converter](https://github.com/PhenixFine/unit-converter) Project.
